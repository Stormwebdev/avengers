            The Avengers are a team of fictional superheroes and the protagonists of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)
            media franchise, based on the Marvel Comics team of the same name created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1963.
            Founded by S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury, the team is a United States-based organization composed primarily of
            superpowered and gifted individuals, described as "Earth's Mightiest Heroes", who are committed to the world's
            protection from a variety of threats. The Avengers are depicted as operating in the state of New York:
            originally from the Avengers Tower in Midtown Manhattan and subsequently in the Avengers Compound in Upstate New
            York. Arranged as an ensemble of core MCU characters originally consisting of Tony Stark / Iron Man, Steve
            Rogers / Captain America, Thor, Bruce Banner / Hulk, Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, and Clint Barton / Hawkeye,
            it later expands to include 16 total members. Regarded as an important part of the franchise, they are central
            to the MCU's first 23 films, collectively known as the Infinity Saga. The Avengers from alternate universes were
            depicted in subsequent MCU properties across the Multiverse Saga, including appearances in the Disney+ animated
            series What If...? (2021–present) and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022). The Avengers are set
            to return in Avengers: Doomsday (2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars (2027). Both films will be part of the MCU's
            Phase Six, concluding the Multiverse Saga.
    
            Following the formation Marvel Studios as an independent film studio by Avi Arad, the head of Marvel's film
            division, producer Kevin Feige envisioned creating a shared cinematic universe to introduce the Avengers,
            similar to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's comic books in the 1960s. Once Feige became studio chief in 2007 and formed
            his creative team, his strategy involved creating individual films for each major character in Phase One,
            beginning with Iron Man (2008) and concluding with The Avengers (2012). Casting for the original six members
            occurred from 2006 to 2010, beginning with Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man and concluding with Mark Ruffalo
            replacing Edward Norton as the Hulk by 2010. Successive MCU installments introduced new members, with actors
            from other MCU films reprising their roles. Following the financial and critical success of The Avengers, a
            sequel, Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), was subsequently developed, with Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth
            Olsen joining as Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, respectively. Then, Captain America: Civil War (2016) was gradually
            reworked into a film influenced by the "Civil War" comic storyline, depicting the Avengers's division and
            introducing Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man. Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019)
            concluded the Infinity Saga and depicted their disbandment.
    
            The four Avengers films are currently the third highest-grossing superhero franchise and the sixth
            highest-grossing film franchise of all time, grossing more than US$7.7 billion. The Avengers have received
            praise as a group from critics including their dynamic together, with Endgame received praise from critics as a
            conclusion for that iteration of the team. Due to their successful introduction, other film studios decided to
            create own shared superhero universes, notably DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. Pictures announcing plans to
            release a Justice League film. Avengers Campus, a series of attractions at various Disney Parks, opened in June
            2021 at Disney California Adventure, while an immersive family dining experience called "Avengers: Quantum
            Encounter" debuted at the Worlds of Marvel restaurant in the Disney Wish cruise ship in July 2022</p>
